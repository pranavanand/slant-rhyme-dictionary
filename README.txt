Pronounciation data taken from CMU - http://svn.code.sf.net/p/cmusphinx/code/trunk/cmudict/
Dictionary from - https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words_dictionary.json

TODO:
 - Order results by consonant sounds (fricative etc.)
 - Enable more slant rhymes by mixing vowel sounds e.g. sycophAnt -> sycophInt

Code is quite messy - quick project
